Backend developer and DevOps engineer at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) focused on automation, scale, and building reliable systems that simplify complex tasks.

At IBM, I work on [Event Streams](https://www.ibm.com/products/event-streams) on Cloud (managed Apache Kafka), creating and maintaining infrastructure that's stable and resilient under pressure. I believe in clear, maintainable code, efficient automation, and practical tooling.

Outside work: smart home projects, tooling experimŸents, and exploring the intersection of security and modern infrastructure. I share notes, ideas, and occasional thoughts at [chivers.dev](https://chivers.dev).

If you're working on backend systems, secure automation, or appreciate thoughtful developer tools — I'm always open to connecting.
